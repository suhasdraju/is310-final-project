Framing the Project
  - Introduce Your Selected Topic
    - Explain the Rationale for your selection
      - The reason that I selected this topic was because becaause of my interest in the NBA and in the sport of basketball in general. Adding onto that was my deep interest
        in statistical and data analysis. Therefore, I was very keen on combining my two interests in both basketball with the NBA as well as statistical and data analysis. 
        I am deeply intrigued on how the efficiency rating of a player is found which is why I decided to study if there is any correlation between the points that a certain
        NBA player averages and the player efficiency rating that a player has. 
    
    - Describe your interests in the project and previous experience (if anything) with the subject area
      - I have done a similar project to this for my Mathematics Internal Assessment back when I was in the IB program at my high school. 
      - My interests in this project lie within the NBA as well as statistical analysis as mentioned above. 
      
    - List and explain outside resources and projects that you plan to use as a reference or example. 
      - I will be using basketball-reference.com's point per game tracker for this season as it is the most up to date site that updates every player's points per game averages. 
      - I will also be using espn.com's NBA player effiency rating tracker which has all the updated efficiency ratings for each player. 
      
 Proposed Methodology
    - Detail how you plan to approach working on this topic
      - I plan to compare the current NBA season to the season back in 2002-2003 to see how the making of the efficiency ratings of NBA players have differed over time. 
        I will have 2 tales with columns for points per game as well as player efficiency ratings. I will use a regression test/analysis  to see whether there is a correlation 
        between the two. I will also plot the data using graphs and charts as well. 
    
    - If you are asking a research question (i.e. taking a more data-driven approach), explain how you plan to turn your topic into a question that can be answered with data
      - My question is: Does the player efficiency rating of NBA players solely depend on their points per game? 
      - I plan to turn this question into data by using a regression test and statistical analysis after gathering my data for the topic/question at hand. 
      
    - Describe how you will get data for this project. Do you have access to existing data? Or do you need to collect data? 
      - I will be collecting data using the basketball reference link for points per game for nba players as well as using the espn link for the player efficiency ratings 
        for players for both this season as well as the 2002-03 season. 
        
    - Explain what methods you will use and why
      - I will be using a regression analysis test by finding the r value of my data to see how strong the correlation between the points per game that an NBA player 
        averages as well as their respective player efficiency rating. I find this to be the most effective and efficient method to do this because it is the most 
        accurate way to compare two data driven fields to find correlation. 
        
 Detailed Work Plan 
    - List how you plan to breakdown the tasks required to complete the work over the remainder of the semester 
      - Firstly I will work on the background information section/abstract of my project where I will explain and give context about my topic, present my research question
        as well as present my hypothesis. 
      - Then I will work on collecting and presenting the data of both the points per game as well as the player efficiency ratings for NBA players while adding needed context.
      - Then I will calculate a table of regression values for both of the seasons that I am comparing to each other. 
      - Then I will work on finding the r value (correlation coefficient) to determine how strong or weak the correlation is between these two things. 
      - Then I will show/depict the data points and the r value in a graph to show how close the data points are to each other with the line of correlation as well. 
      - Then I will give my analysis of the data and finally end with a conclusion on whether my hypothesis was correct or wrong.
